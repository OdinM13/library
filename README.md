# Library App

A personal book management application created as part of **The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum**. This project focuses on object-oriented programming, data structures, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

## Built With

* **HTML5** – Semantic structure and `<dialog>` element.
* **CSS3** – Custom properties, Grid, and Flexbox for the "Emerald Scholar" layout.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Object constructors, `crypto.randomUUID()` for unique IDs, and state-driven UI rendering.

## Features

* **Dynamic Card Grid**: A responsive layout that automatically updates when books are added or removed.
* **Interactive Modal**: A clean entry form for new books using the native HTML `<dialog>` API.
* **Live Status Toggle**: Instantly switch a book's "Read" status between "Yes" and "No" without a page refresh.
* **Collection Management**: Easily delete books from the library with real-time UI synchronization.
* **Data Integrity**: Uses a "Source of Truth" pattern where the UI always reflects the underlying JavaScript array.
